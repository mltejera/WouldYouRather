Welcome to Mason's Would You Rather Project!

This project lets create polls, answer them and compete with other voters!

I used Node.js to install, launch and run the project.

First, navigate your console to the project directory

Then install the project dependencies: npm install

Finally, start the http server: npm start

Node will then launch the app in your default browser.

Happy Voting!
